 Shell scripting is writing a series of command for the shell to execute. It can combine lengthy and repetitive sequences of commands into a simple script, which can be stored and executed anytime. This reduces the time and effort required by the end user.

 # Let us understand the steps in creating a Shell Script : -

 * Create a file using a vi editor(or any other editor).  Name  script file with extension .sh
 * Start the script with #! /bin/sh
 * Write some code.
 * Save the script file as filename.sh
 * For executing the script type bash filename.sh
